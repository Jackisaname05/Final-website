            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;color: aliceblue;">Accommodation</h2>
            <p>Accommodation costs can be a significant part of a student's expenses. To save money, students can consider options such as sharing accommodation with roommates to split costs, living in student residences offered by universities which may be more affordable, or seeking accommodation in areas with lower rent prices. Websites like <a href="https://www.daft.ie/" style="color:aliceblue;">Daft.ie</a> and <a href="https://www.collegecribs.ie/" style="color:aliceblue;">CollegeCribs.ie</a> list rental properties tailored to students' budgets.</p>
            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;color: aliceblue;">Transportation</h2>
            <p>Students can save on transportation costs by utilizing student discounts on public transportation fares, such as the Student Leap Card offering reduced rates for bus, rail, and Luas services  <a href="https://about.leapcard.ie/young-adult-and-student-card-launch" style="color:aliceblue;">Leap Card application</a>. Additionally, cycling or walking can be cost-effective alternatives for short distances. Carpooling with classmates for longer journeys can also help share expenses.</p>
            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;color: aliceblue;">Food and Groceries</h2>
            <p>To reduce food expenses, students can plan meals in advance, prepare homemade meals instead of eating out, and buy groceries in bulk or during sales. Utilizing loyalty cards from supermarkets can also earn discounts or rewards points on purchases. Moreover, exploring local markets or discount stores for fresh produce and essentials can offer more budget-friendly options.</p>
            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;color: aliceblue;">Textbooks and Course Materials</h2>
            <p>Students can save on textbooks and course materials by purchasing second-hand books from online platforms like <a href="https://www.bookfinder.com/" style="color:aliceblue;">BookFinder</a>, borrowing books from the university library, or utilizing e-books and digital resources when available. Additionally, forming study groups with classmates allows students to share resources and split costs for textbooks or study materials.</p>
